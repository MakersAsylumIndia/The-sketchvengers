### Problem Statement

Millions of blind and visually impaired individuals often lack access to tactile graphics and printed Braille resources due to the absence of easy, affordable, and open-source tools. Existing solutions are expensive, limited in flexibility, or too technical for everyday users like educators and students.

---

### Our Solution

We are building a **Braille Plotter Bot**, a low-cost, open-source machine capable of transforming digital content into tactile Braille and diagrams. The bot receives commands from Inkscape and plots:

- Typed text converted into embossed Braille
- Braille-ready SVG files
- Tactile images made of dotted patterns for shapes, outlines, and textures

The bot uses a precision-controlled pen mechanism to emboss dots on thick paper, making it ideal for educational institutions, maker labs, and accessibility-focused classrooms.

### Hardware Used

üñ®Ô∏è Plotting Mechanism  
- EasyDraw V2 "(frame)"
- Braille-embossing pen mount  
- 180gsm+ Paper or plastic tactile sheets  

üß† Controller & Power  
- Arduino Uno / ESP32 ‚Äì For motion control and serial communication  
- CNC Shield (for Arduino)  
- A4988 Stepper Drivers  
- Power Supply Unit (12V recommended)  

---

### Software Used

üß© **Inkscape + Custom Extensions**  
Used to convert typed text and images into Braille or dotted tactile graphics.

üß∞ **Python**  
To process SVG files, convert to coordinate data, and send to the plotter via serial commands.

‚öôÔ∏è **GRBL Firmware** *(if using Arduino)*  
Handles G-code and low-level stepper movement logic.

üì¶ Libraries & Tools  
- `pyserial` ‚Äì For communication with Arduino/ESP32  
- `svgpathtools` ‚Äì For SVG path parsing  
- `inkex`, `lxml` ‚Äì For Inkscape extension development
